# Introduction

This repo stores the notes taken for the following Udemy course: [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide) [Started: 18/1/21]

## Section 1: Getting Started

### What is React Native?

- React: A JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces
- React Native:
  - A collection of React components, which can be compiled to Native Widgets.
  - Access to Native Platform APIs
  - Connects JavaScript and Native Platform Code

### How React Native works

- Special components such as **View**, **Text**, etc. are used in React Native, and are compiled to **Native Applications** - **Views** are compiled.
- React Native maps re-usable components to the respective platform equivalents.
- Other logic in JavaScript aside from views: **runs on a JavaScript thread hosted by React Native App**

### Expo vs React Native CLI

**Expo**

- Third party service 
- Managed App Development, development environment is simplified
- Limited to Expo Ecosystem

**React Native CLI**

- Maintained by RN team and community
- Basic setup: Xcode and Android Studio needed and so on. Setup process for extra features is longer than Expo
- More flexible - can be integrated with any Native Code

**This course uses Expo**

- 'Expo Client' - app useful for development
- Expo allows for app to be published standalone, no reliance on Expo Client

### Creating our First React Native App - using Expo

[Expo Documentation for installing and setting up an Expo application](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

### More on RN apps 

- No / little cross platform styling of components
- Only a basic set of pre-built components - based on the basics we are provided
- Tools available for responsive design - no responsiveness out of the box

### Running the App on Android / iOS

- [Android Simulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/)
